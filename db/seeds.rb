scenario: "<div>
<p><strong>EXT. QUIET HILLS RECOVERY CENTER - DAY</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sitting in a wheelchair and grumpy as hell, FRANK NICHOLS (89), angrily works skeletal fingers in a vain attempt to remove a thick electronic BRACELET from his left arm.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:144.0pt;'><strong>FRANK</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:72.0pt;'>It&rsquo;s a damned invasion of my personal privacy is what it is.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Readouts blink steadily. Frank stares at them, rapt.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:144.0pt;'><strong>FRANK</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:72.0pt;'>I don&rsquo;t want to see my heart beat.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Standing behind Frank, BILL (60), Frank&rsquo;s son, places a calm hand on Frank&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:144.0pt;'><strong>BILL</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:72.0pt;'>You need to be monitored, Dad. Mary and I live too far away to help if something should happen. It&rsquo;s either the bracelet or a home companion. Your choice.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Frank stews in his juices, then smacks the bracelet hard on the arm of his wheelchair.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>INT. FRANK&rsquo;S HOUSE - DAY</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A scratch at the door. The doorbell rings. More scratching.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:144.0pt;'><strong>FRANK (O.S.)</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:72.0pt;'>I&rsquo;m coming, I&rsquo;m coming. Hold your horses.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Relying heavily on a walker, Frank shuffles towards the door.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Arthritic hands struggle with the doorknob and finally succeed. The door opens, revealing -</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A large, handsome, alert GERMAN SHEPARD.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Frank looks at the pooch. Leans out. Looks around. Shrugs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:144.0pt;'><strong>FRANK</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:72.0pt;'>Who rang the bell?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The dog, CARL, looks up at Frank with soulful eyes.</p>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;
<div>
<p style='margin-left:144.0pt;'><strong>CARL</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:72.0pt;'>I did, Frank. My name is Carl.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Frank gawks at the talking dog, then stumbles backwards. Carl follows and closes the door behind him.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>INT. KITCHEN - DAY</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Carl sits alert while Frank nervously makes coffee.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:144.0pt;'><strong>FRANK</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:72.0pt;'>They didn&rsquo;t say anything about my companion being a talking dog.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Carl looks Frank up and down. Says nothing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:144.0pt;'><strong>FRANK</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:72.0pt;'>I mean, I&rsquo;m allergic to dogs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Frank snatches a Kleenex from the counter, wipes his nose.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:144.0pt;'><strong>CARL</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:72.0pt;'>Don&rsquo;t worry, Frank. I&rsquo;m not a real dog. I&rsquo;m a Complex, Artificial, Realistic, Lifeform. C.A.R.L. Carl. And totally non-allergenic.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Frank crumples the snot rag, sniffs the air, grimaces.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Frank scoots his walker to a comfy chair and falls into it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:144.0pt;'><strong>FRANK</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:72.0pt;'>Rules. Gotta follow the rules. And my landlord won&rsquo;t allow Complex, Realistic, uh, dogs in his -</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Carl taps his head with his left paw.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:144.0pt;'><strong>CARL</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:72.0pt;'>It&rsquo;s all in my noggin, Frank. Your entire portfolio. I know that you&rsquo;ve owned this home free and clear for over twenty years.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Frank&rsquo;s eyes crinkle in a scowl.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>EXT. BATHROOM DOOR - DAY</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Carl sits patiently outside the bathroom door.</p>
</div>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;
<div>
<p style='margin-left:144.0pt;'><strong>FRANK (O.S.)</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:72.0pt;'>What about food? I can barely remember to feed myself.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Carl stands on his hind legs and opens the bathroom door.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>INT. BATHROOM - DAY</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sitting on the toilet, Frank jerks in surprise, letting out a SQUEAKY FART, as Carl enters.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Carl remains upright as a hatch on his belly opens, revealing all sorts of high tech components.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:144.0pt;'><strong>CARL</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:72.0pt;'>Cold fusion powered. A little water each week and I&rsquo;m good. And between you and me, I kinda prefer toilet water. The porcelain adds a certain something -</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:144.0pt;'><strong>FRANK</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:72.0pt;'>Do you mind? I&rsquo;m trying to, er...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Carl&rsquo;s brown eyes widen, his tail droops and he backs out, closing the door behind him.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:144.0pt;'><strong>CARL (O.S.)</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:72.0pt;'>Sorry. I should have knocked.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Frustrated, Frank&rsquo;s hands clench into gnarled fists. Then, his eyebrows raise with a thought.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:144.0pt;'><strong>FRANK</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:72.0pt;'>You sound like a pretty high tech pup, alright. What if something happens to those computers and gadgets and stuff inside you? I can&rsquo;t afford those kind of repairs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:144.0pt;'><strong>CARL (O.S.)</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:72.0pt;'>Bumper to bumper warranty, Frank.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:101.0pt;'><strong>FRANK (under his breath)</strong></p>

<p style='margin-left:101.0pt;'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:72.0pt;'>Dang it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Frank eyes search the room for inspiration - and find it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:144.0pt;'><strong>FRANK</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:72.0pt;'>I&rsquo;m in no condition to take you for walkees when you need to, you know, do what I&rsquo;m doing right now.</p>
</div>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;
<div>
<p>A pause, then a knock on the door. Frank rolls his eyes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:144.0pt;'><strong>FRANK</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:72.0pt;'>For goodness sake. Come in!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The door swings open slowly. Carl faces Frank, tail wagging.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:144.0pt;'><strong>CARL</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:72.0pt;'>I&rsquo;m totally self contained. You don&rsquo;t have to worry about a thing. In fact, I&rsquo;ll clean up after you. Plus, I cook, do the laundry and can administer all of your necessary medications.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Frank stares at Carl, words not coming, and reaches for the toilet paper. Carl gets the hint and turns to leave.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sitting on the edge of his bed, Frank pulls on a nightshirt.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:144.0pt;'><strong>FRANK</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:72.0pt;'>Sounds to me like you&rsquo;re nothing more than a flea bitten nursemaid. I suppose you&rsquo;re gonna report my every move to my doctors and family, too.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Carl gazes up at Frank with sad, brown doggy eyes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:144.0pt;'><strong>CARL</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:72.0pt;'>It&rsquo;s not like that at all, Frank. I&rsquo;m here to help you. I&rsquo;ll be by your side day and night. If you need something, I&rsquo;ll fetch it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Frank looks dubious, then turns his attention to his night stand, searching.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:144.0pt;'><strong>FRANK</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:72.0pt;'>Where&rsquo;s the darned TV remote?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Carl sniffs around and retrieves the remote from under the bed. He sets it gently next to Frank&rsquo;s hand.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:144.0pt;'><strong>FRANK</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:72.0pt;'>I don&rsquo;t need a nurse maid. I don&rsquo;t need a dog, neither. I don&rsquo;t need nothin&rsquo;. Nothin&rsquo; at all.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>He clicks the remote. Nothing happens. Nothing at all.</p>
</div>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;
<p style='margin-left:144.0pt;'><strong>FRANK</strong></p>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:72.0pt;'>&lsquo;Cept maybe some batteries.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Carl stares at the TV and blinks. The TV comes to life.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Frank looks at Carl, then the TV. He smiles slightly.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:144.0pt;'><strong>FRANK</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:72.0pt;'>Nice trick.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:144.0pt;'><strong>CARL</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:72.0pt;'>Thanks. But I&rsquo;m not here to do tricks, Frank.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tail wagging with joy, Carl jumps onto the bed next to Frank.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>He leans his muzzle in close to Frank&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:144.0pt;'><strong>CARL</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:72.0pt;'>I&rsquo;m here to be your best friend.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And with that, Carl licks the entire side of Frank&rsquo;s face, jumps down and curls into a furry ball next to the bed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As Frank slowly wipes the very realistic slobber from his cheek, he looks down at Carl and considers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>His face softens. He reaches down and pats Carl on the head.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Carl lets out a contented sigh.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:144.0pt;'><strong>FRANK</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:72.0pt;'>I guess having a dog won&rsquo;t be so bad. Always wanted a dog, in fact.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Frank looks up at the TV, which shows an informercial. He frowns.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:144.0pt;'><strong>FRANK</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:72.0pt;'>Hey, um, Carl... would you mind switching to ESPN. The ball game&rsquo;s on in a few minutes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Carl&rsquo;s tail wags a little as the TV channel switches over.</p>

<p>Mike and Jay Glauser have been interviewing entrepreneurs together, as father and son, for 6 years now. &nbsp;During the summer of 2014, with a team of 4, they embarked on a 4,000 mile bicycle adventure traveling from the west coast of Oregon to the east coast of Virginia. &nbsp;As technology replaces jobs, their mission was to interview 100 small town entrepreneurs in 100 cities to see how everyday Americans have found success doing what they love, where they want to live.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With no shortage of coverage in the media highlighting big corporations and successful multi mullion dollar tech companies, the smaller successful individuals and businesses in America are often overshadowed and overlooked. &nbsp;Not everyone can create the next Facebook or Google or eBay, but everyone can create businesses that fill needs in their communities.&nbsp;</p><div class='template asset' contenteditable='false' data-id='12664683'>

<p>The people they met and the stories of success they heard during their two month long journey along Main Street America is a something that they want to share with the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A book written by team member Dr. Mike Glauser titled 'Main Street Entrepreneur' was recently released which details their cross country adventure as well as shares the keys to success that are being implemented by the entrepreneurs they interviewed. With so many inspiring stories and examples that each of us can learn from, the team wants to take this project one step further and release a full length feature documentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div class='template oembed' contenteditable='false' data-href='https://vimeo.com/102861992'>

<h1 id='h:chris-washburn-fezza'>Chris Washburn - Fezzari Bicycles</h1><p>Imagine leaving behind a successful career in corporate America in pursuit of finding greater satisfaction doing something you truly love! That's exactly what Chris Washburn did when he created Fezzari Bicycles. High demands of work travel causing him to miss out on family events and a desire to create and do something on his own is what led to this life-changing decision. Fezzari Bicycles is no ordinary bike shop. It's much more than that. Based on three important principles, the company offers 100% customized products to provide every user a perfect fit, guarantees top of the line quality that competes with any high-end bike manufacturer, and deals directly with the consumer to offer the best prices. Chris's story is a testament that greater happiness comes when you're doing something you are passionate about. </p><div class='template asset' contenteditable='false' data-id='12657859'>

<p>According to a recent Gallup pole, 2/3 of US employees are unengaged with their work.  In other words, they aren't happy working jobs that take up 38% of their time during the week.  When you don't like doing something, dedicating an hour to it is torture, let alone 40 hours per week!</p><p>Small businesses and entrepreneurship are key to the success and growth of our economy. The jobs that they create help to replace the ones that are lost to automation and small business owners around the country are spending their work week doing what they love.  By sharing the success stories of dozens of these everyday Americans, we hope to educate, inspire, and motivate others to take control of their lives and spend their time doing something they love through entrepreneurship.</p><div class='template asset' contenteditable='false' data-id='12657914'>
